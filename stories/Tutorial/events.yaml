 Sometimes you want to add some randomness to your story. Random events will
 happen when following a link.

 There are two types of random events:
 - based on dices
 - with a percentage of success

 each type needs a `threshold` field.

 ### Dice rolls
 You can specify how many dices, of how many faces you want; and compare it to
 an arbitrary value.

 Some example:
 - `1d6 = 5`
 - `2d18 > 30`
 - `36d2 < 54`

 ### Percentages
 These ones are simpler, just write it in a natural way like so: `66%`.

 ### yaml structure
 They share the same structure as simple links, but have some fields more (and
 	no `id`):
 
 ```yaml
 next:
 - text: Try rolling a few dices
   threshold: 2d6 > 8
   success: 5
   failure: 6
 - text: Or a percentage
   threshold: 66%
   success: 5
   failure: 6
 ```
