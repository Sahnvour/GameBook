 #### Branching stories are cool, but they become far better when variables come to play.

 The pages can define variables that are assigned a value when the user reaches
 them. You can see the ones defined on this page in the right column.

 The syntax to declare variables is the following:
 ```
 vars:
  - aNumber: 32
  - aBoolean: true
  - aString: Hello world!
 ```
 Variable names must be composed only of ascii letters, and are case-sensitive.

 Variables can be used anywhere in the content of a page, in its title, in link
 texts and, last but not least, in thresholds. When you want to use their value,
 just write their name preceded by a `$`.

 Examples:
 - `$nameVar` will expand to `$myNameIs`
 - `2d$numVar > 20` will expand to `2d15 > 20`

 You can see how I used them to trick the system for displaying things with a $.
 The variables are very basic and can only be assigned or displayed, no
 computations are possible.

 If a page redefines an existent variable, its value is updated.
