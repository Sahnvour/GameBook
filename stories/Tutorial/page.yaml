 ### A page is a [yaml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) file 

 Its name isn't important to the application, but it should contain **mandatory
 fields**:

 |Field name|Role|
 |----------|----|
 |id        |Page number used to identify it|
 |title|Title of the page|
 |content|Content of the page, in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) format|
 
 As an example, here is the yaml version of this very page:

 ```yaml
     title: Page structure
     id: 2

     content: |
     # Page structure
