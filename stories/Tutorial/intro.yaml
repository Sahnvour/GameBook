 # Story structure

 ### A story is a succession of pages.

 The player traverse the story by going from page to page until he is stuck in
 a dead-end or he reaches the end. Each page is composed of a text describing 
 what happens in the story, and links to 0, 1 or more pages to continue the
 story.

 ### On the server

 A story is a simple directory containing `.yaml` files. The name of the story
 comes from the name of the directory.
